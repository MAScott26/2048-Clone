# Process

What did i learn? a lot more goes into what seems to be a simple game. its very difficult to get evrything moving and interacting properly.

Where did i get stuck?. Merging tiles properly, and movement, popping additional tiles in.

What would i like to improve? everything. its a game that vaguely resembles what it's supposed to be

how would i do it differently? allow myself more time. I didnt spend enough time or give myself enough time to finish and work on everything

How far did i stray from the game design Document? my product is incomplete. it has the same ideas of what 2048 should be, but its a poor mimic of what it tries to be.

how did you stay on track? i didnt. I fell off the track, and had to  try to complete the race when everyone was close to the finish line.
